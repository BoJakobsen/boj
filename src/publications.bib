Glycerol-water liquid mixtures have a high concentration of hydrogen bonds which usually is expected to lead to complex dynamics. However{,} with regard to the pressure dependence of the dynamics we reveal a surprisingly simple picture. Different aspects of the dynamics have the same pressure dependence{,} in other words the phase diagram of the liquids have so-called isodynes{,} density scaling is also observed to hold reasonably well and there is even some reminiscence of isochronal superposition. This suggests that these aspect of liquid dynamics are very general and hold for different types of intermolecular interactions.",

However models have not been tested on all relevant length scales due to a lack of appropriate probes. Here we present a universal X-ray based method for providing data on the structure of rubbers in the 2--50 Å range. First results relate to the elongation of a silicone rubber. We identify several non-entropic contributions to the free energy and describe the associated structural changes. By far the largest contribution comes from structural changes within the individual monomers, but among the contributions is also an elastic strain, acting between chains, which is 3--4 orders of magnitude smaller than the macroscopic strain, and of the opposite sign, i.e. extension of polymer chains in the direction perpendicular to the stretch. This may be due to trapped entanglements relaxing to positions close to the covalent crosslinks.},

                  is based on monitoring the temperature and its rate

                  which the thermal power input comes from heat

                  sample and surroundings. The monitored signal
                  reflects the sample's specific heat and is sensitive

                  useful for studying supercooled liquids and their

The temperature and pressure dependences of the characteristic time scale associated with the specific heat is comed to the equivalent time scale from dielectric spectroscopy performed under identical conditions. It is shown that the ratio between the two time scales is independent of both temperature and pressure. This observation is non-trivial and demonstrates the existence of specially simple molecular liquids in which different physical relaxation processes are both as function of temperature and pressure/density governed by the same underlying "inner clock." Furthermore, the results are discussed in terms of the recent conjecture that van der Waals liquids, like the measuredliquid, comply to the isomorph theory.},

The amine and thiol can form hydrogen bonds weaker in strength than those of the alcohol. The combination of dielectric and shear-mechanical data enables us to reveal the presence of a relaxation mode slower than the alpha-relaxation. This mode is analogous to the Debye mode seen in monohydroxy alcohols and demonstrates that supramolecular structures are present for systems with lower hydrogen bonding strength. We report some key features accompanying the decrease in the strength of the hydrogen bonding interactions on the relaxationdynamics close to the glass-transition. This includes changes (i) in the amplitude of the Debye and alpha-relaxations and (ii) the seation between primary and secondary modes.},

                  Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 098301 (2014)] of two
                  supercooled monohydroxy alcohols close to the
                  glass-transition temperature showed that the Debye
                  peak, thus far mainly observed in the electrical
                  response, also has a mechanical signature. In this
                  work, we apply broadband shear-mechanical
                  spectroscopy to a systematic series of octanol
                  structural isomers, x-methyl-3-heptanol (with x
                  ranging from 2 to 6).We find that the
                  characteristics of the mechanical signature overall
                  follow the systematic behavior observed in
                  dielectric spectroscopy. However, the influence from
                  the molecular structure is strikingly small in
                  mechanics (comed to roughly a factor 100 increase
                  in dielectric strength) and one isomer clearly does
                  not conform to the general ordering. Finally, the
                  mechanical data surprisingly indicate that the size
                  of the supramolecular structures responsible for the
                  Debye process is nearly unchanged in the series.  },

  abstract={Understanding the origin of the dramatic temperature and
                  density dependence of the relaxation time of
                  glass-forming liquids is a fundamental challenge in
                  glass science. The recently established
                  "density-scaling" relation quantifies the relative
                  importance of temperature and density for the
                  relaxation time in terms of a material-dependent
                  exponent. We show that this exponent for approximate
                  single-ameter liquids can be calculated from
                  thermoviscoelastic linear-response data at a single
                  state point, for instance an ambient-pressure state
                  point. This prediction is confirmed for the van der
                  Waals liquid
                  tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-trisiloxane. Consistent with
                  this, a compilation of literature data for the
                  Prigogine-Defay ratio shows that van derWaals
                  liquids and polymers are approximate
                  single-ameter systems, whereas associated and

                  5-polyphenyl-4-ether. The method employs thermal
                  waves effusing radially out from the surface of a
                  spherical thermistor that acts as both a heat
                  generator and a thermometer. It is a merit of the
                  method comed to planar effusion methods that the
                  influence of the mechanical boundary conditions is
                  analytically known. This implies that it is the
                  longitudinal rather than the isobaric specific heat
                  that is measured. As another merit the thermal
                  conductivity and specific heat can be found

 abstract={The temperature dependency of the characteristic timescale of the
structural relaxation is a major ameter when characterizing viscous
liquids. However, it is not possible to assign one unique timescale, as
this depends on the type of response which is analyzed. Likewise the
temperature dependency might also depend on the probed response function. \\
\ \\
In this work we come time scales from 5 different, independent,
response functions which can all be measured under identical
conditions in our laboratory: Shear modulus [1,2], adiabatic bulk
modulus [3,2], longitudinal thermal expansion coefficient [4,5],
longitudinal specific heat [6] and dielectric response. The data
presented is on the molecular glass-former
tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-trisiloxane (the Dow Corning DC704 diffusion-pump
oil).\\
\ \\
Based on this data the differences in absolute timescale and
temperature dependency between the response functions are
discussed. We conclude that the shear modulus is faster than all the
other response functions, and that the timescales generally follow
each other very closely.\\

abstract={
The major source for information on secondary relaxations is dielectric spectroscopy.
The connection between dielectric response and the more fundamental
mechanical relaxation is, however, not trivial.
The piezoelectric shear-modulus gauge [1] allows for direct studies of the
frequency dependent shear modulus in a frequency range from 1mHz to 10KHz,
on liquids with moduli in the MPa to GPa range. Hence the method is well
suited for studying the shear-mechanical signature of secondary relaxations.
In this presentation we review our existing shear-mechanical data [2] with
focus on how the phenomenology of the secondary relaxation is seen in the shear
modulus. It is generally observed that when a secondary process is seen by
dielectric relaxation it is also seen in the shear modulus, but phenomenological
differences exist. The loss peak of the process is shifted to higher frequencies
and the strength relative to the alpha relaxation is larger in the shear modulus
comed to the dielectric. The phenomenological differences are furthermore
discussed in terms of the Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model [3].\\

                  superimposed on a cloud of lower intensity arising
                  from dislocationwalls. Individual subgrains can be
                  distinguished by their unique combination of
                  orientation and elastic strain. The responses of
                  polycrystalline copper to different loading
                  conditions are presented: during uninterrupted
                  tensile deformation, formation of subgrains can be

                  reflection shortly after onset of plastic
                  deformation.  With continued tensile deformation,
                  the subgrain structure develops intermittently. When
                  the traction is terminated, stress relaxation occurs
                  and number, size and orientation of subgrains are
                  found to be constant. The subgrain structure freezes
                  and only a minor clean-up of the dislocation

This paper presents dielectric relaxation data for organic
glass-forming liquids compiled from different groups and supplemented
by new measurements. The main quantity of interest is the
``minimum slope'' of the $\alpha$ dielectric loss plotted as a function
of frequency in a log-log plot, i.e., the numerically largest slope
above the loss peak frequency. The data consisting of 347 spectra for
53 liquids show prevalence of minimum slopes close to $-1/2$,
corresponding to approximate t dependence of the dielectric relaxation
function at short times. The paper studies possible correlations
between minimum slopes and (1) temperature quantified via the loss peak
frequency; (2) how well an inverse power-law fits data above the loss
peak; (3) degree of time-temperature superposition; (4) loss peak half
width; (5) deviation from non-Arrhenius behavior; (6) loss strength.  For
the first three points we find correlations that show a special status
of liquids with minimum slopes close to $-1/2$. For the last three points
only fairly insignificant correlations are found, with the exception
of large-loss liquids that have minimum slopes that are numerically
significantly larger than 1/2. We conclude that --- excluding
large-loss liquids --- approximate $\sqrt{t}$ relaxation appears to be a
generic property of the relaxation of organic glass formers.

A $300\mu\mathrm{m}$ thick tensile specimen of OFHC copper is subjected
to a tensile loading sequence and deformed to a maximal
strain of $3.11\%$. Using the novel three-dimensional X-ray
diffraction method ``High angular resolution 3DXRD'', the
evolution of the microstructure within a deeply embedded
grain is characterised in-situ by the behaviour of individual
subgrains. The loading sequence consists of three continuous
deformation stages with strain rates of $1.1\times10^{-6}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and
$3\times10^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, in each case followed by a period of extended
stress relaxation at fixed motor positions, as well as an
unloading step. In contrast to the deformation stages, during
each stress relaxation stage, number, size and orientation of
subgrains are found to be constant, while a minor amount of
clean-up of the microstructure is observed as narrowing of the
radial X-ray diffraction line profile. The associated decrease
in the width of the strain distribution indicates homogenization
of the elastic strains present in the deformation structure.
During reloading, the subgrain structure seemingly starts to
develop further when the entire dislocation structure is deforming
plastically. Upon unloading of the sample, the average
backward strain of the subgrains increases.

shear-mechanical spectra are obtained by the piezoelectric
shear-modulus gauge (PSG) method. This technique allows one to measure
the shear modulus ($10^5--10^{10}$ Pa) of the liquid within a frequency
range from 1 mHz to 10 kHz. We analyze the frequency-dependent
response functions to investigate whether time-temperature
superposition (TTS) is obeyed. We also study the shear-modulus
loss-peak position and its high-frequency t. It has been suggested
that when TTS applies, the high-frequency side of the imaginary t
of the dielectric response decreases like a power law of the frequency
with an exponent -1/2. This conjecture is analyzed on the basis
of the shear mechanical data. We find that TTS is obeyed for
pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane and in 1,2-propanediol while in the
remaining liquids evidence of a mechanical $\beta$ process is
found. Although the high-frequency power law behavior
$\omega^{-\alpha}$ of the shear loss may approach a limiting value of
$\alpha = 0.5$ when lowering the temperature, we find that the exponent
lies systematically above this value (around 0.4). For the two liquids
without $\beta$ relaxation (pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane and
1,2-propanediol) we also test the shoving model prediction, according
to which the relaxation time activation energy is proportional to the
instantaneous shear modulus. We find that the data are well described
by this model.}

Shear-mechanical and dielectric measurements on the two monohydroxy

close to the glass-transition temperature are presented. The
shear-mechanical data are obtained using the piezoelectric
shear-modulus gauge method covering frequencies from 1 mHz to 10
kHz. The shear-mechanical relaxation spectra show two processes, which
follow the typical scenario of a structural (alpha) relaxation and an
additional (Johari-Goldstein) beta relaxation. The dielectric
relaxation spectra are dominated by a Debye-type peak with an
additional non-Debye peak visible. This Debye-type relaxation is a
common feature peculiar to monoalcohols. The time scale of the
non-Debye dielectric relaxation process is shown to correspond to the
mechanical structural (alpha) relaxation. Glass-transition
temperatures and fragilities are reported based on the mechanical
alpha relaxation and the dielectric Debye-type process, showing that
the two glass-transition temperatures differ by approximately 10 K and
that the fragility based on the Debye-type process is a factor of 2
smaller than the structural fragility. If a mechanical signature of
the Debye-type relaxation exists in these liquids, its relaxation
strength is at most $1\%$ and $3\%$ of the full relaxation strength of
2-butanol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, respectively. These findings support
the notion that it is the non-Debye dielectric relaxation process that
corresponds to the structural alpha relaxation in the liquid.

  majority of glass-forming liquids require more than one 'order'
  ameter for their description. Critiques against this conventional
  wisdom are then presented, and it is argued that the matter deserves
  to be reconsidered in the light of recent experimental
  developments. Out of the eight basic thermoviscoelastic
  frequency-dependent response functions, there are generally three
  independent functions. For stochastic dynamics we show that there
  are only two independent response functions; for this case it is
  shown how analytic continuation may be utilized to express the third
  response functions in terms of two others. Operational criteria are
  presented for the linear thermoviscoelasticity being described by a
  single 'order' ameter, in which case there is just one
  independent thermoviscoelastic response function. It is shown that a
  description with a single 'order' ameter applies to a good
  approximation whenever thermal equilibrium fluctuations of
  fundamental variables like energy and pressure are strongly
  correlated. Results from computer simulations showing that this is
  the case for a number of simple glass-forming liquids, as well as a
  few exceptions, are briefly presented. Finally, we briefly discuss a
  new conjecture according to which experiments at varying temperature
  and pressure follow the density scaling expression for the
  relaxation time, $\tau = F(\rho^x/T)$ ($\rho$ and T are density and
  temperature), if and only if the liquid is 'strongly correlating',

a mature tool to investigate the microstructure in the bulk of

is a study of grain rotations during plastic tensile deformation of
polycrystalline aluminium. The second is the acquisition of a video

The Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model, which connects the
frequency-dependent shear modulus to the frequency-dependent
dielectric constant, is reviewed and a new consistent macroscopic
formulation is derived. It is moreover shown that this version of the
model can be tested without fitting ameters. The reformulated
version of the model is analyzed and experimentally tested. It is
demonstrated that the model has several nontrivial qualitative
predictions: the existence of an elastic contribution to the
high-frequency limit of the dielectric constant, a shift of the shear
modulus loss peak frequency to higher frequencies comed with the
loss peak frequency of the dielectric constant, a broader alpha peak,
and a more pronounced beta peak in the shear modulus when comed
with the dielectric constant. It is shown that these predictions
generally agree with experimental findings and it is therefore
suggested that the Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model is correct on a
qualitative level. The quantitative agreement between the model and
the data is on the other hand moderate to poor. It is discussed if a
model-free comison between the dielectric and shear mechanical
relaxations is relevant, and it is concluded that the shear modulus
should be comed with the rotational dielectric modulus, $1/(\epsilon(\omega)-n^2)$, which is extracted from the Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model,
rather than to the dielectric susceptibility or the conventional
dielectric modulus $M=1/\epsilon(\omega)$.

  taken on seven liquids: triphenylethylene,
  tetramethyltetra-phenyltrisiloxane Dow Corning 704® diffusion pump
  fluid, polyphenyl ether Santovac® 5 vacuum pump fluid,
  perhydrosqualene, polybutadiene, decahydroisoquinoline DHIQ, and
  tripropylene glycol. The shear mechanical and dielectric
  measurements are for each liquid performed under identical thermal
  conditions close to the glass transition temperature. The liquids
  span four orders of magnitude in dielectric relaxation strength and
  include liquids with and without Johari-Goldstein beta
  relaxation. The shear mechanical data are obtained by the
  piezoelectric shear modulus gauge method giving a large frequency
  span $10^{-3}-10^{4.5}$ Hz. This allows us to resolve the shear
  mechanical Johari-Goldstein beta peak in the equilibrium DHIQ
  liquid. We moreover report a signature a pronounced rise in the
  shear mechanical loss at frequencies above the alpha relaxation of a
  Johari-Goldstein beta relaxation in the shear mechanical spectra for
  all the liquids which show a beta relaxation in the dielectric
  spectrum. It is found that both the alpha and beta loss peaks are
  shifted to higher frequencies in the shear mechanical spectrum
  comed to the dielectric spectrum. It is in both the shear and
  dielectric responses found that liquids obeying time-temperature
  superposition also have a high-frequency power law with exponent
  close to -1/2. It is moreover seen that the less temperature
  dependent the spectral shape is, the closer it is to the universal
  -1/2 power-law behavior. The deviation from this universal power-law
  behavior and the temperature dependencies of the spectral shape are
  rationalized as coming from interactions between the alpha and beta
  relaxations.},
