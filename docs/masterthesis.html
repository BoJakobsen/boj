<h2>Abstract of the thesis <a name="abstract"></a></h2>
The goal of this thesis is to elucidate whether a relation can be
established between shear mechanical and dielectric relaxation in
glass forming liquids.
The starting point is a generalized Debye model, which has been
proposed by DiMarzio and Bishop [J.Chem.Phys.
<B>60</B> (1974) 3802]. 
<p>
The DiMarzio-Bishop model is thoroughly analyzed and reformulated in
such a way that different unphysical simplifications that have been
used earlier, are avoided. New testable qualitative predictions of the
DiMarzio-Bishop model are formulated and the model is put in a form
where quantitative tests can be made by using only one macroscopic
parameter.
<p>
The DiMarzio-Bishop model is tested by extensive dielectric and shear
mechanical measurements on various molecular liquids. The shear
mechanical measurements are performed using a transducer that has been
developed at IMFUFA by Christensen and Olsen [Rev. Sci.
Instrum. <b>66</b> (1995) 5019]. This transducer allows measurements
to be made in an exceptionally large frequency range (1mHz-50kHz). The
systematic errors and uncertainties of the two measuring methods are
analyzed in detail. Furthermore these errors and uncertainties are
taken into account in the reformulation and tests of the
DiMarzio-Bishop model.
<p>
It is found that the DiMarzio-Bishop model to a large extend has
qualitative agreement with our data and data from the literature,
whereas the quantitative agreement is moderate or poor depending on
the liquid tested. This suggests that the model is too coarse grained
to capture details of the relaxation processes, but that it does in
fact capture the fundamentals of the physics involved, and
consequently that there is a direct relation between shear mechanical
relaxation and dielectric relaxation.

A viscoelastic liquid behaves as a liquid at long time scales whereas
it behaves as a solid on short time scales, and the characteristic
time scale of the corresponding relaxation is strongly temperature
dependent. The temperature dependence and the nature of this
relaxation are the most fundamental questions in this area of
research.<p>

We study the relaxation process by measuring and comparing the
frequency dependency of the shear mechanical modulus and of the
dielectric constant. The primary motivation for this is that any
relation between shear- and dielectric relaxation, whether
quantitative or qualitative, would be a stepping stone in the
direction of understanding the microscopic dynamics behind the
relaxation processes.<p>

The study is based on measurements on various molecular liquids and
small polymers. The dielectric measurements are performed using
standard methods (1mHz-1MHz), whereas the shear mechanical
measurements are performed using a transducer which has been developed
at IMFUFA [Rev. Sci.  Instrum. <b>66</b> (1995) 5019] to obtain a
large frequency range (1mHz-50kHz).<p> 

The temperature dependency of
the two relaxations are compared and a model [J. Chem. Phys. <b>60</b>
(1974) 3802], [J. Non-Cryst. Solids, <b>172-174</b> (1994) 357] of the
connection between the two relaxation processes is tested.

<H2><A NAME="resume"> Scope of our work</A></H2> 
The main goal of the
thesis is to elucidate whether a quantitative relation can be
established between shear mechanical and dielectric relaxation in
glass-forming liquids. This is done with special focus on liquids that
exhibit a secondary relaxation process.  The study has two main
motivations: 1) Such a relation would be a very strong tool in testing
the shoving model [Phys. Rev. B <B>53</B> (1996) 2171]. This model is
difficult to test on substances with a secondary relaxation because it
includes the values of the shear modulus in the megahertz region,
which can not yet be measured; the dielectric constant however is
easily measured in this region. 2) Any relation between shear- and
dielectric relaxation, whether quantitative or qualitative, would be
a stepping stone in the direction of understanding the microscopic
dynamics behind relaxation processes (especially the secondary
relaxation which is still strongly debated [Non-Cryst.  Solids,
<B>307-310</B> (2002) 317], and on how the many different relaxations
(heat capacity, bulk modulus, thermal expansivity) are related.<P>

The starting point has been a generalized Debey model which has been
proposed in two slightly different versions in [J.Chem.Phys.
<B>60</B> (1974) 3802] and [J.Non-Cryst. Solids, <B>172-174</B> (1994)
357]. In the master thesis this model has been thoroughly analyzed and
reformulated such that different erroneous simplifications which have
been used earlier are avoided.<P>

The model is tested by extensive dielectric and shear mechanical
measurements on various molecular liquids. The dielectric
measurements are standard whereas the shear mechanical measurements
are performed using a transducer which has been developed at IMFUFA
[Rev. Sci. Instrum. <B>66</B> (1995) 5019] allowing measurements to be
made in large frequency range (1mHz-50kHz), and hereby obtaining the
best possible test of the model. The liquids are chosen in two
catagories: 1) Liquids that exhibit no secondary relaxation and obey
time-temperature superposition are examined in order to test the model
for these ``well behaved'' liquids. 2) Liquids with secondary
relaxations are chosen such that the loss peak of the secondary
relaxation lies in the narrow interval where it can be separated from
the primary relaxation and still be access by the shear mechanical
measurements (100Hz-1kHz).

One of the reasons to chose liquids with a secondary relaxation is
that it gives us a relaxation spectrum with more features which the
model has to capture in order to fit. It also opens the possibility of
examining whether the model holds better for the primary than the
secondary relaxation, as it has been suggested in
[J. Chem. Phys.<b>107</b> (1997) 3645].
