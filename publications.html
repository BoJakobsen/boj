This paper presents dielectric and neutron spectroscopy data on two different glycerol-water mixtures at elevated pressures. Glycerol-water liquid mixtures have a high concentration of hydrogen bonds which usually is expected to lead to complex dynamics. However, with regard to the pressure dependence of the dynamics we reveal a surprisingly simple picture. Different aspects of the dynamics have the same pressure dependence, in other words the phase diagram of the liquids have so-called isodynes, density scaling is also observed to hold reasonably well and there is even some reminiscence of isochronal superposition. This suggests that these aspect of liquid dynamics are very general and hold for different types of intermolecular interactions.

Conventionally, the stretching of rubber is modeled exclusively by rotations of segments of the embedded polymer chains; i.e. changes in entropy. However models have not been tested on all relevant length scales due to a lack of appropriate probes. Here we present a universal X-ray based method for providing data on the structure of rubbers in the 2&ndash;50 Å range. First results relate to the elongation of a silicone rubber. We identify several non-entropic contributions to the free energy and describe the associated structural changes. By far the largest contribution comes from structural changes within the individual monomers, but among the contributions is also an elastic strain, acting between chains, which is 3--4 orders of magnitude smaller than the macroscopic strain, and of the opposite sign, i.e. extension of polymer chains in the direction perpendicular to the stretch. This may be due to trapped entanglements relaxing to positions close to the covalent crosslinks.

 Thermalization calorimetry: A simple method for investigating glass

We present a simple method for fast and cheap
                  thermal analysis on supercooled glass-forming
                  liquids. This &ldquo;Thermalization Calorimetry&rdquo; technique
                  is based on monitoring the temperature and its rate
                  of change during heating or cooling of a sample for
                  which the thermal power input comes from heat
                  conduction through an insulating material, i.e., is
                  proportional to the temperature difference between
                  sample and surroundings. The monitored signal
                  reflects the sample's specific heat and is sensitive
                  to exo- and endothermic processes. The technique is
                  useful for studying supercooled liquids and their
                  crystallization, e.g., for locating the glass
                  transition and melting point(s), as well as for
                  investigating the stability against crystallization
                  and estimating the relative change in specific heat
                  between the solid and liquid phases at the glass
                  transition.

 High pressure specific heat spectroscopy reveals simple relaxation

The frequency dependent specific heat has been measured under pressure for the molecular glass forming liquid 5-polyphenyl-4-ether in the viscous regime close to the glass transition. The temperature and pressure dependences of the characteristic time scale associated with the specific heat is comed to the equivalent time scale from dielectric spectroscopy performed under identical conditions. It is shown that the ratio between the two time scales is independent of both temperature and pressure. This observation is non-trivial and demonstrates the existence of specially simple molecular liquids in which different physical relaxation processes are both as function of temperature and pressure/density governed by the same underlying "inner clock." Furthermore, the results are discussed in terms of the recent conjecture that van der Waals liquids, like the measuredliquid, comply to the isomorph theory.

 Communication: Slow supramolecular mode in amine and thiol

  In this paper, we present results of dielectric and shear-mechanical studies for amine (2-ethyl-1-hexylamine) and thiol (2-ethyl-1-hexanethiol) derivatives of the monohydroxy alcohol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. The amine and thiol can form hydrogen bonds weaker in strength than those of the alcohol. The combination of dielectric and shear-mechanical data enables us to reveal the presence of a relaxation mode slower than the alpha-relaxation. This mode is analogous to the Debye mode seen in monohydroxy alcohols and demonstrates that supramolecular structures are present for systems with lower hydrogen bonding strength. We report some key features accompanying the decrease in the strength of the hydrogen bonding interactions on the relaxationdynamics close to the glass-transition. This includes changes (i) in the amplitude of the Debye and alpha-relaxations and (ii) the seation between primary and secondary modes.

 A recent study [C. Gainaru, R. Figuli, T. Hecksher,
                  B. Jakobsen, J. C. Dyre, M. Wilhelm, and R.  Böhmer,
                  Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 098301 (2014)] of two
                  supercooled monohydroxy alcohols close to the
                  glass-transition temperature showed that the Debye
                  peak, thus far mainly observed in the electrical
                  response, also has a mechanical signature. In this
                  work, we apply broadband shear-mechanical
                  spectroscopy to a systematic series of octanol
                  structural isomers, x-methyl-3-heptanol (with x
                  ranging from 2 to 6).We find that the
                  characteristics of the mechanical signature overall
                  follow the systematic behavior observed in
                  dielectric spectroscopy. However, the influence from
                  the molecular structure is strikingly small in
                  mechanics (comed to roughly a factor 100 increase
                  in dielectric strength) and one isomer clearly does
                  not conform to the general ordering. Finally, the
                  mechanical data surprisingly indicate that the size
                  of the supramolecular structures responsible for the
                  Debye process is nearly unchanged in the series.

The monohydroxy alcohol 5-methyl-3-heptanol is studied using rheology at ambient pressure and using dielectric spectroscopy at elevated pressures up to 1.03 GPa. Both experimental techniques reveal that the relaxational behavior of this liquid is intermediate between those that show a large Debye process, such as 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, or a small Debye-like feature, such as 4-methyl-3-heptanol, with which comisons are made. Various phenomenological approaches assigning a time scale for the rheological signature of supramolecular dynamics in monohydroxy alcohols are discussed.

Liquids composed of small-molecule monohydroxy alcohols
                  are demonstrated to display rheological behavior
                  typical for oligomeric chains. This observation was
                  made possible by rheological experiments in which
                  more than seven decades in frequency and more than
                  five decades on the mechanical modulus scale are
                  covered. The singly hydrogen-bonded monohydroxy
                  alcohols were chosen because they display
                  significant, but surprisingly poorly understood
                  effects of intermolecular association. Based on the
                  present shear study, one can apply theoretical
                  concepts of polymer science to understand the
                  anomalous physical behavior of a wide range of
                  hydrogen-bonded liquids.

 The frequency-dependent dielectric constant, shear and

                  expansion coefficient, and longitudinal specific

                  glass-forming liquids,
                  tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-trisiloxane (DC704) and

                  uncertainties the loss-peak frequencies of the
                  measured response functions have identical
                  temperature dependence over a range of temperatures,
                  for which the Maxwell relaxation time varies more
                  than nine orders of magnitude. The time scales are
                  ordered from fastest to slowest as follows: Shear

Understanding the origin of the dramatic temperature and
                  density dependence of the relaxation time of
                  glass-forming liquids is a fundamental challenge in
                  glass science. The recently established
                  "density-scaling" relation quantifies the relative
                  importance of temperature and density for the
                  relaxation time in terms of a material-dependent
                  exponent. We show that this exponent for approximate
                  single-ameter liquids can be calculated from
                  thermoviscoelastic linear-response data at a single
                  state point, for instance an ambient-pressure state
                  point. This prediction is confirmed for the van der
                  Waals liquid
                  tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-trisiloxane. Consistent with
                  this, a compilation of literature data for the
                  Prigogine-Defay ratio shows that van derWaals
                  liquids and polymers are approximate
                  single-ameter systems, whereas associated and
                  network-forming liquids are not.

The phenomenology of the beta relaxation process in the

                  to such a model are outlined, and it is argued that

We present a method of measuring the frequency-dependent
                  specific heat at the glass transition applied to
                  5-polyphenyl-4-ether. The method employs thermal
                  waves effusing radially out from the surface of a
                  spherical thermistor that acts as both a heat
                  generator and a thermometer. It is a merit of the
                  method comed to planar effusion methods that the
                  influence of the mechanical boundary conditions is
                  analytically known. This implies that it is the
                  longitudinal rather than the isobaric specific heat
                  that is measured. As another merit the thermal
                  conductivity and specific heat can be found

With high angular resolution three-dimensional X-ray
                  diffraction, individual subgrains are traced in the
                  bulk of a polycrystalline specimen and their
                  dynamics is followed in situ during varying loading
                  conditions.  The intensity distribution of single
                  Bragg reflections from an individual grain is
                  analyzed in reciprocal space. It consists of sharp
                  high-intensity peaks arising from subgrains
                  superimposed on a cloud of lower intensity arising
                  from dislocationwalls. Individual subgrains can be
                  distinguished by their unique combination of
                  orientation and elastic strain. The responses of
                  polycrystalline copper to different loading
                  conditions are presented: during uninterrupted
                  tensile deformation, formation of subgrains can be
                  observed concurrently with broadening of the Bragg
                  reflection shortly after onset of plastic
                  deformation.  With continued tensile deformation,
                  the subgrain structure develops intermittently. When
                  the traction is terminated, stress relaxation occurs
                  and number, size and orientation of subgrains are
                  found to be constant. The subgrain structure freezes
                  and only a minor clean-up of the dislocation
                  structure is observed. When changing the tensile
                  direction after pre-deformation in tension, a
                  systematic correlation between the degree of strain
                  path change and the changes in the dislocation
                  structure quantified by the volume fraction of the
                  subgrains is established. For obtaining the subgrain
                  volume fraction, a new fitting method has been
                  developed for titioning the contributions of
                  subgrains and dislocation walls.

This paper presents dielectric relaxation data for organic
glass-forming liquids compiled from different groups and supplemented
by new measurements. The main quantity of interest is the
&ldquo;minimum slope&rdquo; of the &alpha; dielectric loss plotted as a function
of frequency in a log-log plot, i.e., the numerically largest slope
above the loss peak frequency. The data consisting of 347 spectra for
53 liquids show prevalence of minimum slopes close to -1/2,
corresponding to approximate t dependence of the dielectric relaxation
function at short times. The paper studies possible correlations
between minimum slopes and (1) temperature quantified via the loss peak
frequency; (2) how well an inverse power-law fits data above the loss
peak; (3) degree of time-temperature superposition; (4) loss peak half
width; (5) deviation from non-Arrhenius behavior; (6) loss strength.  For
the first three points we find correlations that show a special status
of liquids with minimum slopes close to -1/2. For the last three points
only fairly insignificant correlations are found, with the exception
of large-loss liquids that have minimum slopes that are numerically
significantly larger than 1/2. We conclude that &ndash;- excluding
large-loss liquids &ndash;- approximate sqrt(<em>t</em>) relaxation appears to be a
generic property of the relaxation of organic glass formers.

A 300&mu;<em>m</em> thick tensile specimen of OFHC copper is subjected
to a tensile loading sequence and deformed to a maximal
strain of 3.11%. Using the novel three-dimensional X-ray
diffraction method &ldquo;High angular resolution 3DXRD&rdquo;, the
evolution of the microstructure within a deeply embedded
grain is characterised in-situ by the behaviour of individual
subgrains. The loading sequence consists of three continuous
deformation stages with strain rates of 1.1&#215;10<sup>-6</sup><em>s</em><sup>-1</sup> and
3&#215;10<sup>-2</sup><em>s</em><sup>-1</sup>, in each case followed by a period of extended
stress relaxation at fixed motor positions, as well as an
unloading step. In contrast to the deformation stages, during
each stress relaxation stage, number, size and orientation of
subgrains are found to be constant, while a minor amount of
clean-up of the microstructure is observed as narrowing of the
radial X-ray diffraction line profile. The associated decrease
in the width of the strain distribution indicates homogenization
of the elastic strains present in the deformation structure.
During reloading, the subgrain structure seemingly starts to
develop further when the entire dislocation structure is deforming
plastically. Upon unloading of the sample, the average
backward strain of the subgrains increases.

We report dynamical shear-modulus measurements for five
glass-forming liquids (pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane, diethyl
phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, 1,2-propanediol, and m-touluidine). The
shear-mechanical spectra are obtained by the piezoelectric
shear-modulus gauge (PSG) method. This technique allows one to measure
the shear modulus (10<sup>5</sup>&ndash;10<sup>10</sup> Pa) of the liquid within a frequency
range from 1 mHz to 10 kHz. We analyze the frequency-dependent
response functions to investigate whether time-temperature
superposition (TTS) is obeyed. We also study the shear-modulus
loss-peak position and its high-frequency t. It has been suggested
that when TTS applies, the high-frequency side of the imaginary t
of the dielectric response decreases like a power law of the frequency
with an exponent -1/2. This conjecture is analyzed on the basis
of the shear mechanical data. We find that TTS is obeyed for
pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane and in 1,2-propanediol while in the
remaining liquids evidence of a mechanical &beta; process is
found. Although the high-frequency power law behavior
&omega;<sup>-&alpha;</sup> of the shear loss may approach a limiting value of
&alpha;= 0.5 when lowering the temperature, we find that the exponent
lies systematically above this value (around 0.4). For the two liquids
without &beta; relaxation (pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane and
1,2-propanediol) we also test the shoving model prediction, according
to which the relaxation time activation energy is proportional to the
instantaneous shear modulus. We find that the data are well described
by this model.

Shear-mechanical and dielectric measurements on the two monohydroxy
(monoalcohol) molecular glass formers 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 2-butanol
close to the glass-transition temperature are presented. The
shear-mechanical data are obtained using the piezoelectric
shear-modulus gauge method covering frequencies from 1 mHz to 10
kHz. The shear-mechanical relaxation spectra show two processes, which
follow the typical scenario of a structural (alpha) relaxation and an
additional (Johari-Goldstein) beta relaxation. The dielectric
relaxation spectra are dominated by a Debye-type peak with an
additional non-Debye peak visible. This Debye-type relaxation is a
common feature peculiar to monoalcohols. The time scale of the
non-Debye dielectric relaxation process is shown to correspond to the
mechanical structural (alpha) relaxation. Glass-transition
temperatures and fragilities are reported based on the mechanical
alpha relaxation and the dielectric Debye-type process, showing that
the two glass-transition temperatures differ by approximately 10 K and
that the fragility based on the Debye-type process is a factor of 2
smaller than the structural fragility. If a mechanical signature of
the Debye-type relaxation exists in these liquids, its relaxation
strength is at most 1% and 3% of the full relaxation strength of
2-butanol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, respectively. These findings support
the notion that it is the non-Debye dielectric relaxation process that
corresponds to the structural alpha relaxation in the liquid.

 Glass-forming liquids: one or more 'order' ameters?

We first summarize the classical arguments that the vast
  majority of glass-forming liquids require more than one 'order'
  ameter for their description. Critiques against this conventional
  wisdom are then presented, and it is argued that the matter deserves
  to be reconsidered in the light of recent experimental
  developments. Out of the eight basic thermoviscoelastic
  frequency-dependent response functions, there are generally three
  independent functions. For stochastic dynamics we show that there
  are only two independent response functions; for this case it is
  shown how analytic continuation may be utilized to express the third
  response functions in terms of two others. Operational criteria are
  presented for the linear thermoviscoelasticity being described by a
  single 'order' ameter, in which case there is just one
  independent thermoviscoelastic response function. It is shown that a
  description with a single 'order' ameter applies to a good
  approximation whenever thermal equilibrium fluctuations of
  fundamental variables like energy and pressure are strongly
  correlated. Results from computer simulations showing that this is
  the case for a number of simple glass-forming liquids, as well as a
  few exceptions, are briefly presented. Finally, we briefly discuss a
  new conjecture according to which experiments at varying temperature
  and pressure follow the density scaling expression for the
  relaxation time, &tau;= <em>F</em>(&rho;<sup>x</sup>/<em>T</em>) (&rho; and T are density and
  temperature), if and only if the liquid is 'strongly correlating',
  i.e., to a good approximation is described by a single 'order'
  ameter.

  The X-ray diffraction method &ldquo;High Angular Resolution 3DXRD&rdquo; is
  briefly introduced, and results are presented for a single bulk
  grain in a polycrystalline copper sample deformed in tension.  It is found that the
  3D reciprocal space intensity distribution of a 400 reflection
  associated with the grain, shows a distinct structure consisting of
  sharp bright peaks superimposed on a cloud of enhanced intensity.
  The bright peaks (which arise from individual subgrains) are found
  to be subjected to backward strain (on average) while the fraction
  of the material giving rise to the cloud of enhanced intensity is
  subjected to forward strain. Based on the latter observation the,
  originally tentative, interpretation of the cloud as arising from

For the flow around a circular cylinder, the steady flow
  changes its topology at a Reynolds number around 6 where the flow
  seates and a symmetric double seation zone is created. At the
  bifurcation point, the flow topology is locally degenerate, and by a
  bifurcation analysis we find all possible streamline patterns which
  can occur as perturbations of this flow. We show that there is no a
  priori topological limitation from further assuming that the flow
  fulfils the steady Navier-Stokes equations or from assuming
  that a Hopf bifurcation occurs close to the degenerate flow.  
  The steady flow around a circular cylinder experiences a Hopf
  bifurcation for a Reynolds number about 45&ndash;-49. Assuming that
  this Reynolds number is so close to the value where the steady
  seation occurs that the flow here can be considered a
  perturbation of the degenerate flow, the topological bifurcation
  diagram will contain all possible instantaneous streamline patterns
  in the periodic regime right after the Hopf bifurcation. On the
  basis of the spatial and temporal symmetry associated with the
  circular cylinder and the structure of the topological bifurcation
  diagram, two periodic scenarios of instantaneous streamline patterns
  are conjectured. We confirm numerically the existence of these
  scenarios, and find that the first scenario exists only in a narrow
  range after the Hopf bifurcation whereas the second one persists
  through the entire range of Re where the flow can be considered
  two-dimensional. Our results corroborate previous experimental and
  computational results.

The three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) microscope has become
a mature tool to investigate the microstructure in the bulk of
polycrystalline materials. The present paper describes the 3DXRD
method together with two applications. The first application presented
is a study of grain rotations during plastic tensile deformation of
polycrystalline aluminium. The second is the acquisition of a video
revealing the 3D growth of an embedded nuclei during recrystallization
of a deformed aluminium sample.

 Dielectric and shear mechanical relaxations in glass-forming liquids:
  A test of the Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model.

The Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model, which connects the
frequency-dependent shear modulus to the frequency-dependent
dielectric constant, is reviewed and a new consistent macroscopic
formulation is derived. It is moreover shown that this version of the
model can be tested without fitting ameters. The reformulated
version of the model is analyzed and experimentally tested. It is
demonstrated that the model has several nontrivial qualitative
predictions: the existence of an elastic contribution to the
high-frequency limit of the dielectric constant, a shift of the shear
modulus loss peak frequency to higher frequencies comed with the
loss peak frequency of the dielectric constant, a broader alpha peak,
and a more pronounced beta peak in the shear modulus when comed
with the dielectric constant. It is shown that these predictions
generally agree with experimental findings and it is therefore
suggested that the Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model is correct on a
qualitative level. The quantitative agreement between the model and
the data is on the other hand moderate to poor. It is discussed if a
model-free comison between the dielectric and shear mechanical
relaxations is relevant, and it is concluded that the shear modulus
should be comed with the rotational dielectric modulus, 1/(&epsilon;(&omega;)-<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>), which is extracted from the Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model,
rather than to the dielectric susceptibility or the conventional
dielectric modulus <em>M</em>=1/&epsilon;(&omega;).

 Dielectric and shear mechanical alpha and beta relaxations in seven
  glass-forming liquids.

We present shear mechanical and dielectric measurements
  taken on seven liquids: triphenylethylene,
  tetramethyltetra-phenyltrisiloxane Dow Corning 704® diffusion pump
  fluid, polyphenyl ether Santovac® 5 vacuum pump fluid,
  perhydrosqualene, polybutadiene, decahydroisoquinoline DHIQ, and
  tripropylene glycol. The shear mechanical and dielectric
  measurements are for each liquid performed under identical thermal
  conditions close to the glass transition temperature. The liquids
  span four orders of magnitude in dielectric relaxation strength and
  include liquids with and without Johari-Goldstein beta
  relaxation. The shear mechanical data are obtained by the
  piezoelectric shear modulus gauge method giving a large frequency
  span 10<sup>-3</sup>-10<sup>4.5</sup> Hz. This allows us to resolve the shear
  mechanical Johari-Goldstein beta peak in the equilibrium DHIQ
  liquid. We moreover report a signature a pronounced rise in the
  shear mechanical loss at frequencies above the alpha relaxation of a
  Johari-Goldstein beta relaxation in the shear mechanical spectra for
  all the liquids which show a beta relaxation in the dielectric
  spectrum. It is found that both the alpha and beta loss peaks are
  shifted to higher frequencies in the shear mechanical spectrum
  comed to the dielectric spectrum. It is in both the shear and
  dielectric responses found that liquids obeying time-temperature
  superposition also have a high-frequency power law with exponent
  close to -1/2. It is moreover seen that the less temperature
  dependent the spectral shape is, the closer it is to the universal
  -1/2 power-law behavior. The deviation from this universal power-law
  behavior and the temperature dependencies of the spectral shape are
  rationalized as coming from interactions between the alpha and beta
  relaxations.

<button type="button" class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button> <span class="abstract">
The temperature dependency of the characteristic timescale of the
structural relaxation is a major ameter when characterizing viscous
liquids. However, it is not possible to assign one unique timescale, as
this depends on the type of response which is analyzed. Likewise the
temperature dependency might also depend on the probed response function. <br>
 <br>
In this work we come time scales from 5 different, independent,
response functions which can all be measured under identical
conditions in our laboratory: Shear modulus [1,2], adiabatic bulk
modulus [3,2], longitudinal thermal expansion coefficient [4,5],
longitudinal specific heat [6] and dielectric response. The data
presented is on the molecular glass-former
tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-trisiloxane (the Dow Corning DC704 diffusion-pump
oil).<br>
 <br>
Based on this data the differences in absolute timescale and
temperature dependency between the response functions are
discussed. We conclude that the shear modulus is faster than all the
other response functions, and that the timescales generally follow
each other very closely.<br>

<button type="button" class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button> <span class="abstract">

The major source for information on secondary relaxations is dielectric spectroscopy.
The connection between dielectric response and the more fundamental
mechanical relaxation is, however, not trivial.
The piezoelectric shear-modulus gauge [1] allows for direct studies of the
frequency dependent shear modulus in a frequency range from 1mHz to 10KHz,
on liquids with moduli in the MPa to GPa range. Hence the method is well
suited for studying the shear-mechanical signature of secondary relaxations.
In this presentation we review our existing shear-mechanical data [2] with
focus on how the phenomenology of the secondary relaxation is seen in the shear
modulus. It is generally observed that when a secondary process is seen by
dielectric relaxation it is also seen in the shear modulus, but phenomenological
differences exist. The loss peak of the process is shifted to higher frequencies
and the strength relative to the alpha relaxation is larger in the shear modulus
comed to the dielectric. The phenomenological differences are furthermore
discussed in terms of the Gemant-DiMarzio-Bishop model [3].<br>
